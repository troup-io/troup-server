The Troup client is the frontend app that helps the user address problems that we aim to solve. The client is built atop wonderful open-source projects with the goal of providing a fluid experience to the user.

**Languages:**

-   [Typescript][typescript]

**Libraries:**

-   [Apollo Server][apollo-server]
-   [Prisma][prisma]
-   [Nexus Schema][nexus-schema]

## `.env` Setup

You will need to add two `.env` files into the project to get it up and running. The first `.env` file should be created on the root of the project and contains the following information:

```
NODE_ENV="development"
APP_SECRET="jwtsecret123"
NODE_PATH="./src"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public"
```

The second `.env` file should be created in the `prisma` folder and contains the following information:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public"
```

## Available scripts

### `yarn boostrap`

Bootstrap the database and the server. This will also seed your local database.

### `yarn dev`

Start the development server and watch for file changes.

### `yarn build`

Build the production-optimised bundle for deployment.

### `yarn start`

Deploy the production-optimised bundle locally to test and simulate the production environment.

### `yarn lint`

Run the linter, catching out any errors or warning that may occur.

### `yarn cmd`

The raw command runner. All commands that are listed as `category:command` can be run using `yarn cmd category command`.
For example, the [`app:dev`][app-dev] command can run as `yarn cmd app dev`.

### UNSAFE: `yarn reset`

Use this if something has gone horribly wrong with your database. It wipes out all data, clears out all volumes and containers and restarts a new container.
